recipes for AutoPkg.

Recipes here are for tools that i use and for which there was no autopkg recipe done.

For Some of them, when there is one or more files shipped with the App (Readme, UserGuide, examples...)
I install them with the App in a folder named from the App name.
I usually also provide an -AppOnly.munki recipe for this applications for those who want to install only
the app without the folder and other files.
